Problem:

An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the differences
between consecutive integers are equal. For example, [9, 10], [3, 3, 3], and [9, 7, 5, 3]are
arithmetic arrays,while [1, 3, 3, 7], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 4] are not arithmetic arrays.

Sarasvati has an array of N non-negative integers. The i-th integer of the array is A[i] .. She
wants to choose a contiguous arithmetic subarray from her array that has the maximum
length.Please help her to determine the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic
subarray.
